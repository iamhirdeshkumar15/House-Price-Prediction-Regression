# Images Folder

This folder contains visualizations and graphical representations related to the house prices prediction project. The images include:

- **Actual vs Predicted Prices Plot**: A scatter plot comparing the actual house prices with the predicted values from the multiple linear regression model.
- **Residuals Plot**: A visualization showing the residuals (errors) of the model's predictions, helping to evaluate the performance of the model.

These visualizations are generated by the R script and provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by the model.
